This is cassie 0.1, a symbolic calculation library developed in Python.
It can currently simplify some expressions and compute derivatives, including partial and implicit derivatives.
The laboratory directory is where I put my in-progress algorithms.

The stray python files are some test python scripts. Try them out!

It currently has 4 components, and I will introduce them in order of completeness:

polynomial - an array based polynomial type
Allows for easy calculations, should be hybridized with expression trees

tree - expression-tree based computation
More flexible than cassie.polynomial, simplification not complete

parsers - where the parsing/ui code goes.
it currently parses polynomials with infix notation and parses RPN to expression trees

numerics - numerical algorithms
currently it has a numerical integration algorithm and a function to numerically approximate derivatives
it is also capable of solving quadratics

Now for the legal stuff:
This is under the 3-clause BSD
